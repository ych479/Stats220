# Stats220
## About this repo
This repository includes files that I develop and use for my Stats220 course at the University of Auckland.
This course is all about data technology, which contains:
* data acquisition
* data storage 
* data processing
We use **R**, **Rstudio** and **CSS** to build up our own *HTML* pages.
Here is a web link for my [Stats220 repo](https://ych479.github.io/Stats220/)
